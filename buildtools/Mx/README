The Mx documentation tool enables the programmer to keep source code
and documentation in a single file.  Thus once the program is finished
the documentation of the program is also written.  The use of a text
formatter enables the programmer to express more clearly properties of
the program.

To compile, first run the script
	./bootstrap
then do the usual sequence,
	./configure
	make
	make install

Use
	./configure --help
to find out the options you can give to configure.
