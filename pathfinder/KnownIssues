 -- The Pathfinder compiler does not allow nested XQuery comments.
    A query like

      (: a (: nested :) comment :)
      (1, 2)

    thus produces a parsing error.

    [For developers:
      Within grouped tokens this is hard to implement. Between
      tokens, however, we could support this by introducing an
      additional lexical state, similar to the proposal in older
      W3C drafts.]

 -- Pathfinder does not support XQuery library modules. Declaring
    or importing such modules produces an error message.

 -- The sequence types `schema-element (...)' and schema-attribute (...)'
    are not supported by the Pathfinder compiler. There are also issues
    with the processing-instruction() and document-node() tests.

 -- Features not supported by the Pathfinder compiler: `castable',
    Collations, base-uri declaration, construction mode declaration.

 -- We do not (yet) support validation.

 -- We do not (yet) support external variables and functions.

    [For developers: We'd only need a proper way to do this with MonetDB.]
