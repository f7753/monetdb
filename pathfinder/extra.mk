# extra make rules for Pathfinder

# Twig checks its argument to end in `.mt'. Unfortunately
# it does that the wrong way and will fail if the pathname
# of the argument contains dots (which is the case in the
# automated test environment).
# We thus copy the source file into the ``safe'' filename
# `tmp.mt' and run twig on that. The proper solution would
# of course be fixing Twig.
%.symbols.h %.c : %.mt
	$(LOCKFILE) waiting_for_twig
	$(CP) $< tmp.mt
	$(TWIG) -t tmp.mt
	mv -f symbols.h $*.symbols.h
	sed 's/^short\(.*\)=/static short\1=/' walker.c > $*.c
	$(RM) walker.c
	$(RM) tmp.mt
	$(RM) waiting_for_twig

# Some files need to be preprocessed with the stream editor `sed'.
# The required sed expressions are contained in the source files
# themselves; they carry a special marker that we use during the
# build.
# We first ``grep'' for all lines in the source file that contain
# the marker. We translate this marker into an sed expression
# (using sed; we map `*!sed 'pattern'' to `-e 'pattern'', as it
# can be passed to sed on the command line). The resulting sed
# expression is the used as the sed command line argument when
# we feed the source file through sed.
% :: %.sed

# We do not only produce HTML documentation, so `html' is actually
