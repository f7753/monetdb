"PARAMETERS
  doc: document BAT (preorder rank, postorder rank)
  context: context node sequence (preorder rank, postorder rank)
  height: document height
  upperbound: upperbound for size of result context node sequence
DESCRIPTION
doc represents a collection of (x,y) coordinates of nodes where
each x- and each y-coordinate occurs only once. context represents
a sub-collection of 'boundary nodes'. For each boundary node,
staircasejoin uselects all nodes from doc (x-coordinates), which
have an x-coordinate between the boundary node and the next one (or
right edge of the xy-plane in case there is no next), and an y-coordinate
smaller than the y-coordinate of the boundary node. context effectively
represents a boundary in the xy-plane of doc for which staircasejoin
uselects the nodes in the bottom-right part. @2"
