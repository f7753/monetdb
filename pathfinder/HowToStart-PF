This document will help you compile and install the MonetDB XQuery front end
"Pathfinder".

In case you prefer to install a pre-compiled binary distribution, please
check-out http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56967 .

This document assumes that you have installed MonetDB on a Unix system
(e.g., Linux, IRIX, Solaris, AIX, MacOs X/Darwin, or CYGWIN), and that
you are planning to compile and install the Pathfinder front end on 
the same system.
For the time being, Pathfinder is not available for native Windows systems
(NT, 2000, XP). A respective port will be available soon.


Prerequisites:
==============

CVS
	You need to have a working CVS.  For instructions, see
	http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1 and look under the
	heading CVS Instructions.

Python
	Pathfinder uses Python (version 2.0.0 or better) during
	configuration of the software.  See http://www.python.org/ for
	more information.

autoconf/automake/libtool 
	Pathfinder uses GNU autoconf (>= 2.53), automake (>= 1.5), and
	libtool (>= 1.4) during configuration of the software.  See
	http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/,
	http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/, and
	http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
	for more information.  Libtool is also used during the build.

standard software development tools
	To compile Pathfinder, you also need to have a the following 
	standard software development tools installed and ready for use
	on you system:
	 - a C/C++ compiler (e.g., GNU's gcc/g++)
	 - a lexical analyzer generator (e.g., "lex" or "flex")
	 - a parser generator (e.g., "yacc" or "bison")
	 - GNU make ("gmake") (native make's on, e.g., IRIX and Solaris
	   usually don't work)

twig (tree pattern matcher generator)
	Pathfinder uses twig to facilitate tree pattern matching in the
	XQuery compiler. In case you do not have twig installed on your
	system, and you cannot find it anywhere else, please feel free to
	contact us.

gc (the Hans Boehm garbage collector)
	Pathfinder also requires the Hans Boehm garbage collector (gc).  In
	case it is nt installed be default on your system, please get it
	from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ .

dlcompat (MacOS X/Darwin, only)
	MacOS X/Darwin itself does not support dlopen, however, there's
	a third-party library called dlcompat from Fink that provides
	the respective functionality.  Pathfinder requires dlcompat to be
	installed on MacOS X/Darwin.
	(http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/dlcompat)

disk space
	After downloading, Pathfinder takes up about 7 MB of disk space;
	compilation adds another 18 MB.  Testing takes about 10 MB, and
	the installation about 4 MB (not including any databases).

(See also the INSTALL file for more details about requirements for compiling
and installing Pathfinder.)


Getting the Software:
=====================

There are two ways to get the source code:
(1) checking it out from the CVS repository on SourceForge;
(2) downloading the pre-packaged source distribution form
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56967 .

The following instruction first describe how to check out the source code
from the CVS repository on SourceForge.

CVS checkout
------------

This command should be done once.  It records a password on the local
machine to be used for all subsequent CVS accesses with this server.

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb login

Just type RETURN when asked for the password.

Then get the software by using the command:

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb checkout pathfinder

This will create a directory 'pathfinder' in your current working directory.

Also see http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=56967 for more
information.


Bootstrap, Configure and Make:
==============================

Before executing the following steps, make sure that your
shell-environment (especially variables like "PATH" and
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH") is setup, thus that the tools listed above as well
as MonetDB can be found.
("Bash"-users at CWI and DD are welcome to simply 
  "source conf/conf.bash".
 This sets the proper environment and even provides aliases
 "configure_pathfinder" & "Mtest_pathfinder" for convenience.
 See conf/conf.bash itself for more details.)

In case you did checkout the CVS version, you have to run "bootstrap", first.
In the top-level directory of 'pathfinder' type the command:

 ./bootstrap

If it responds with an error message, it means the MonetDB server 
could not be found, or less likely, you have not installed 
MonetDB properly.

Then in any directory (preferably a *new empty* directory and *not* in the
'pathfinder' top-level directory) give the command

 .../configure [<options>]

where ... is replaced with the (absolute or relative) path to the
pathfinder top-level directory.
The directory where you execute configure is the place where all 
intermediate source and object files are generated during compilation 
via "make".

By default, Pathfinder is eventually (i.e., during "make install"; see
below) installed to /usr/local/.  To choose another target directory, 
you need to call
 .../configure --prefix=<prefixdir> [<options>]
Usually, it is most convenient to the directory where the MonetDB server is
install also as target directory for installing Pathfinder.
A sample of other useful configure options is:
  --enable-debug          enable full debugging default=off
  --enable-optimize       enable extra optimization default=off
  --enable-warning        enable extended compiler warnings default=off
  --enable-profile        enable profiling default=off
  --enable-instrument     enable instrument default=off
  --with-gcc=<compiler>   which C compiler to use
                          ("yes" = gcc/g++, 
                           "no"  = system-specific C/C++ compiler,
                           <other-compiler-name>)
  --with-gxx=<compiler>   which C++ compiler to use
  --with-bits=<#bits>     specify number of bits (32 or 64)
Use the --help option of configure to find out more about configure
options.

In the same directory (where you called configure) give the command

 make

to compile the source code.

On my lightly loaded, dual 1.4 GHz Athlon Linux system, configure takes
about 20 seconds, and make about one minute.


Testing the Build:
==================

If make went successfully, you can try

 make check

This will do a lot of tests, some are unfortunately still expected to
fail, but most should go successfully.  At the end of the output there
is a reference to an HTML file which is created by the test process and
shows the test results.  An explanation of the test results can be found
in XXX--to be filled in.

Testing takes about 10 MB of disk space in the build directory.

Running the tests takes about 3 minutes on my system.


Installing:
===========

Give the command

 make install

By default (if no --prefix option was given to configure above), this
will install in /usr/local/.  Make sure you have appropriate privileges.


Testing the Installation:
=========================

Make sure that /usr/local/bin (respectively <monetdb-prefix>/bin and
<pathfinder-prefix>/bin, where <monetdb-prefix> and <pathfinder-prefix> are the
directories you specified with --prefix when calling configure for
MonetDB and Pathfinder, respectively) is in your PATH.

In case you started your compilation with "source conf/conf.bash" (see 
"Configure and Make" above), you can use the "Mtest_pathfinder" alias, now.
In the pathfinder top-level directory issue the command

 Mtest_pathfinder  -r

It will run a large number of tests to assure correct installation.

In case you did not use "source conf/conf.bash", you need to type more.
Let <pathfinder-source>, <pathfinder-build>, and <pathfinder-prefix> denote the absolute or
relative path to the pathfinder top-level source directory, the directory
where you called configure for pathfinder, and the directory you specified as
--prefix with pathfinder's configure, respectively.
Then, the test runs as follows from the pathfinder top-level directory:

 Mtest.py --monet_mod_path=<monetdb-prefix>/lib/MonetDB:<pathfinder-prefix>/lib/MonetDB --PATHFINDER_PREFIX=<pathfinder-prefix> --TSTSRCBASE=<pathfinder-source> --TSTBLDBASE=<pathfinder-build> --TSTTRGBASE=<pathfinder-prefix> -r

You need write permissions on part of the installation directory for
this command: it will create subdirectories var/dbfarm and Tests.


Documentation:
==============

Unfortunately, there is no further user documentation for Pathfinder, yet.
We're working on it. For now, please accept our apologies for the
inconvenience...


Usage:
======

The MonetDB/Pathfinder system consists of two components:

 - the MonetDB database server/backend (aka. "Mserver")
 - the XQuery compiler (aka. "pf")

For further information about then MonetDB database server see the
respective documentation.

The XQuery compiler ("pf") is a stand-alone program, that translates XQuery
into the query language of the respective database backend. In our case,
that is MonetDB's Interface Language MIL.

To use the Pathfinder front end, you first need to start a MonetDB server
("Mserver") with pathfinder support. To do so, first make sure, that your
environment is set as described in "Configure and Make" and "Testing the
Installation" above.

In case the install- (i.e., prefix-) directories of MonetDB and
Pathfinder are identical, simply call

 Mserver --dbinit='module("pathfinder");' <monetdb-prefix>/lib/MonetDB/mapi.mil

In case you use different install- (i.e., prefix-) directories for MonetDB
and Pathfinder, call

 Mserver --set monet_mod_path=<monetdb-prefix>/lib/MonetDB:<pathfinder-prefix>/lib/MonetDB --dbinit='module("pathfinder");' <monetdb-prefix>/lib/MonetDB/mapi.mil

Then, in a second shell, set up the same environment to prepare the following steps:


Loading an XML document:
------------------------

To load an XML document (persistently) into the database, you need to start
an Mserver as described above. Then, there are two alternatives:

1) On the Mserver's MIL console, type

    shred_doc("/MyPath/MyDoc.xml","MyDoc.xml");

2) In a second shell, start a MapiClient by simply calling

    MapiClient

   and then give the same MIL command as above:

    shred_doc("/MyPath/MyDoc.xml","MyDoc.xml");

Note, the first parameter of "shred_doc" must be the *absolute* path to the
XML document. The second parameter is the name that can then be used to
refer the document using XQuery's built-in "doc" function.

Once "shred_doc" has successfully finished, the document is persistently
loaded into the database, hence, it will still be available after stopping
and restarting the Mserver.


Executing XQuery queries:
-------------------------

The XQuery compiler ("pf") read XQuery queries (for now only one at a time)
either from a file or from standard input, and outputs the respective MIL
code on standard output.

To execute XQuery queries, first start an Mserver as described above, and
load XML documents as necessary/desired.

Then, there are several alternatives, e.g.:
(All following commands are to be executed in a second shell, next to the
running Mserver.)

- To type and run a single XQuery query interactively, start

   pf -M | MapiClient

  type your query followed by a newline (enter/return) and a "Ctrl-D".

- You can also echo your XQuery query into pf:

   echo 'for $a in (1,2) return $a' | pf -M | MapiClient

- Or read you XQuery query from a file MyQuery.xq:

   pf -M MyQuery.xq | MapiClient

- ...

See

 pf -h

for more information about the XQuery compiler.

Note, for now, only the "summer version" produces executeable MIL code,
hence, the "-M" option is mandatory to execute XQuery queries.


Troubleshooting:
================

Bootstrap fails if any of the requisite programs can not be found or
is an incompatible version.

Bootstrap adds files to the source directory, so it must have write
permissions.

During bootstrap, warnings like
	Remember to add `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to `configure.in'.
	You should add the contents of `/usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4' to `aclocal.m4'.
	configure.in:37: warning: do not use m4_patsubst: use patsubst or m4_bpatsubst
	configure.in:104: warning: AC_PROG_LEX invoked multiple times
	configure.in:334: warning: do not use m4_regexp: use regexp or m4_bregexp
	automake/aclocal 1.6.3 is older than 1.7.
	Patching aclocal.m4 for Intel compiler on Linux (icc/ecc).
	patching file aclocal.m4
	Hunk #1 FAILED at 2542.
	1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file aclocal.m4.rej
	patching file aclocal.m4
	Hunk #1 FAILED at 1184.
	Hunk #2 FAILED at 2444.
	Hunk #3 FAILED at 2464.
	3 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file aclocal.m4.rej
might occur.
For some technical reasons, it's hard to completely avoid them. However,
it is usually save to ignore them and simply proceed with the usual 
compilation procedure. Only in case the subsequent configure or make
do fail, these warning might have to be take more serious; in any case, 
you should include the bootstrap output in whenever you report (see below)
compilation problems.

Configure will fail if certain essential programs can't be found or
certain essential tasks (such as compiling a C program) can't be
executed.  The problem will usually be clear from the error message.

E.g., if configure cannot find package XYZ, it is either not installed
on your machine, or it is not installed in places that configure
usually searches (i.e., /usr, /usr/local).  In the first case, you need
to install package XYZ before you can configure, make, and install
MonetDB.  In the latter case, you need to tell configure via
"--with-XYZ=<DIR>" where to find packages XYZ on your machine. 
configure then looks for the respective header files in <DIR>/include,
and for the respective libraries in <DIR>/lib.

In case either of "bootstrap", "configure", or "make" fails --- especially
after a "cvs update", or after you changed some code yourself --- please try
the following step (in that order; if you are using the pre-packages source
distribution, you have to skip steps 2 & 3):

0) In case only "make" fails, you can try to run
	make clean
   in your build-directory and proceed with step 5; 
   however, if "make" then still fails, you have to re-start with step 1.
1) Clean-up your whole build-directory (i.e., the one where you run
   "configure" and "make") by going there and running
	make maintainer-clean
   In case your build-directory is different from your source directory,
   your are even advised to remove the whole build-directory.
2) Go to the top-level source directory and run
	./de-bootstrap
   This will remove all the files that were created during "bootstrap".
3) In the top-level source directory, re-run
	./bootstrap
4) In the build-directory, re-run
	configure
   as described above.
5) In the build-directory, re-run
	make
	make install
   as described above.
