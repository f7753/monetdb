This document will help you compile and install the MonetDB XQuery front end
"Pathfinder".

In case you prefer to install a pre-compiled binary distribution, please
check-out http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56967 .

This document assumes that you have installed MonetDB on a Unix system
(e.g., Linux, IRIX, Solaris, AIX, MacOs X/Darwin, or CYGWIN), and that
you are planning to compile and install the Pathfinder front end on 
the same system.
For the time being, Pathfinder is not available for native Windows systems
(NT, 2000, XP). A respective port will be available soon.


Prerequisites:
==============

CVS
	You need to have a working CVS.  For instructions, see
	http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1 and look under the
	heading CVS Instructions.

Python
	Pathfinder uses Python (version 2.0.0 or better) during
	configuration of the software.  See http://www.python.org/ for
	more information.

autoconf/automake/libtool 
	Pathfinder uses GNU autoconf (>= 2.53), automake (>= 1.5), and
	libtool (>= 1.4) during configuration of the software.  See
	http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/,
	http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/, and
	http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
	for more information.  Libtool is also used during the build.

standard software development tools
	To compile Pathfinder, you also need to have a the following 
	standard software development tools installed and ready for use
	on you system:
	 - a C/C++ compiler (e.g., GNU's gcc/g++)
	 - a lexical analyzer generator (e.g., "lex" or "flex")
	 - a parser generator (e.g., "yacc" or "bison")
	 - GNU make ("gmake") (native make's on, e.g., IRIX and Solaris
	   usually don't work)

gc (the Hans Boehm garbage collector)
	Pathfinder also requires the Hans Boehm garbage collector (gc).  In
	case it is not installed be default on your system, please get it
	from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ .

	Note that in order to enable server-size xquery compilation 
        (recommended), you need to compile MonetDB as well with --with-gc.

dlcompat (MacOS X/Darwin, only)
	MacOS X/Darwin itself does not support dlopen, however, there's
	a third-party library called dlcompat from Fink that provides
	the respective functionality.  Pathfinder requires dlcompat to be
	installed on MacOS X/Darwin.
	(http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/dlcompat)

disk space
	After downloading, Pathfinder takes up about 7 MB of disk space;
	compilation adds another 18 MB.  Testing takes about 10 MB, and
	the installation about 4 MB (not including any databases).

(See also the INSTALL file for more details about requirements for compiling
and installing Pathfinder.)


Getting the Software:
=====================

There are two ways to get the source code:
(1) checking it out from the CVS repository on SourceForge;
(2) downloading the pre-packaged source distribution form
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56967 .

The following instruction first describe how to check out the source code
from the CVS repository on SourceForge.

CVS checkout
------------

This command should be done once.  It records a password on the local
machine to be used for all subsequent CVS accesses with this server.

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb login

Just type RETURN when asked for the password.

Then get the software by using the command:

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb checkout pathfinder

This will create a directory 'pathfinder' in your current working directory.

Also see http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=56967 for more
information.


Bootstrap, Configure and Make:
==============================

Before executing the following steps, make sure that your
shell-environment (especially variables like "PATH" and
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH") is setup, thus that the tools listed above as well
as MonetDB can be found.
("Bash"-users at CWI and DD are welcome to simply 
  "source conf/conf.bash".
 This sets the proper environment and even provides aliases
 "configure_pathfinder" & "Mtest_pathfinder" for convenience.
 See conf/conf.bash itself for more details.)

In case you did checkout the CVS version, you have to run "bootstrap", first.
In the top-level directory of 'pathfinder' type the command:

 ./bootstrap

If it responds with an error message, it means the MonetDB server 
could not be found, or less likely, you have not installed 
MonetDB properly.

Then in any directory (preferably a *new empty* directory and *not* in the
'pathfinder' top-level directory) give the command

 .../configure [<options>]

where ... is replaced with the (absolute or relative) path to the
pathfinder top-level directory.
The directory where you execute configure is the place where all 
intermediate source and object files are generated during compilation 
via "make".

By default, Pathfinder is eventually (i.e., during "make install"; see
below) installed to /usr/local/.  To choose another target directory, 
you need to call
 .../configure --prefix=<prefixdir> [<options>]
Usually, it is most convenient to the directory where the MonetDB server is
install also as target directory for installing Pathfinder.
A sample of other useful configure options is:
  --enable-debug          enable full debugging default=off
  --enable-optimize       enable extra optimization default=off
  --enable-warning        enable extended compiler warnings default=off
  --enable-profile        enable profiling default=off
  --enable-instrument     enable instrument default=off
  --with-gcc=<compiler>   which C compiler to use
                          ("yes" = gcc/g++, 
                           "no"  = system-specific C/C++ compiler,
                           <other-compiler-name>)
  --with-gxx=<compiler>   which C++ compiler to use
  --with-bits=<#bits>     specify number of bits (32 or 64)
Use the --help option of configure to find out more about configure
options.

In the same directory (where you called configure) give the command

 make

to compile the source code.

On my lightly loaded, dual 1.4 GHz Athlon Linux system, configure takes
about 20 seconds, and make about one minute.


Testing the Build:
==================

If make went successfully, you can try

 make check

This will do a lot of tests, some are unfortunately still expected to
fail, but most should go successfully.  At the end of the output there
is a reference to an HTML file which is created by the test process and
shows the test results.  An explanation of the test results can be found
in XXX--to be filled in.

Testing takes about 10 MB of disk space in the build directory.

Running the tests takes about 3 minutes on my system.


Installing:
===========

Give the command

 make install

By default (if no --prefix option was given to configure above), this
will install in /usr/local/.  Make sure you have appropriate privileges.


Testing the Installation:
=========================

Make sure that /usr/local/bin (respectively <monetdb-prefix>/bin and
<pathfinder-prefix>/bin, where <monetdb-prefix> and <pathfinder-prefix> are the
directories you specified with --prefix when calling configure for
MonetDB and Pathfinder, respectively) is in your PATH.

In case you started your compilation with "source conf/conf.bash" (see 
"Configure and Make" above), you can use the "Mtest_pathfinder" alias, now.
In the pathfinder top-level directory issue the command

 Mtest_pathfinder  -r

It will run a large number of tests to assure correct installation.

In case you did not use "source conf/conf.bash", you need to type more.
Let <pathfinder-source>, <pathfinder-build>, and <pathfinder-prefix> denote the absolute or
relative path to the pathfinder top-level source directory, the directory
where you called configure for pathfinder, and the directory you specified as
--prefix with pathfinder's configure, respectively.
Then, the test runs as follows from the pathfinder top-level directory:

 Mtest.py --monet_mod_path=<monetdb-prefix>/lib/MonetDB:<pathfinder-prefix>/lib/MonetDB --PATHFINDER_PREFIX=<pathfinder-prefix> --TSTSRCBASE=<pathfinder-source> --TSTBLDBASE=<pathfinder-build> --TSTTRGBASE=<pathfinder-prefix> -r

You need write permissions on part of the installation directory for
this command: it will create subdirectories var/dbfarm and Tests.


Documentation:
==============

Unfortunately, there is no further user documentation for Pathfinder, yet.
We're working on it. For now, please accept our apologies for the
inconvenience...


Usage:
======

The MonetDB/Pathfinder system consists of two components:

 - the MonetDB database server/backend (aka. "Mserver")
 - the XQuery compiler (aka. "pf"). It is available as a stand-alone
   utility, but is also contained in the "pathfinder" server module.

For further information about then MonetDB database server see the
respective documentation.

The XQuery compiler ("pf") is a stand-alone program, that translates XQuery
into the query language of the respective database backend. In our case,
that is MonetDB's Interface Language MIL. See the MonetDB documentation
how to execute MIL scripts.

We prefer you to use the XQuery compiler through the pathfinder module,
though. This means that the MonetDB query client "MapiClient" is used
to send xquery requests to the server. 

To use the Pathfinder front end, you first need to start a MonetDB server
("Mserver") with pathfinder support. To do so, first make sure, that your
environment is set as described in "Configure and Make" and "Testing the
Installation" above.

In case the install- (i.e., prefix-) directories of MonetDB and
Pathfinder are identical, simply call

 Mserver --dbinit="module(pathfinder,mapi); pfstart();'

In case you use different install- (i.e., prefix-) directories for MonetDB
and Pathfinder, call

 Mserver --set monet_mod_path=<monetdb-prefix>/lib/MonetDB:<pathfinder-prefix>/lib/MonetDB --dbinit="module(pathfinder,mapi); pfstart();"

Then, in a second shell, set up the same environment to prepare the following steps:


Loading an XML document:
------------------------

You may avoid explicit shredding using the document cache (see next section).

To explicitly ask MonetDB to load an XML document (persistently) into the 
database, you need to start an Mserver as described above, and type some MIL. 
There are two alternatives:

1) On the Mserver's MIL console, type

    shred_doc("/MyPath/MyDoc.xml","MyDoc.xml");

2) In a second shell, start a MapiClient by simply calling

    MapiClient

   and then give the same MIL command as above:

    shred_doc("/MyPath/MyDoc.xml","MyDoc.xml");

Note, the first parameter of "shred_doc" must be an absolute URI.
The (optional) second parameter is a logical name ("alias") that can 
be used to refer the document using XQuery's built-in "fc:doc()" 
function.

Once "shred_doc" has successfully finished, the document is persistently
loaded into the database, hence, it will still be available after stopping
and restarting the Mserver.

The Document Cache
------------------

Mserver allows te use of any URI in the fn:doc() xquery function,
such that you can query XML documents in local files, on FTP sites, 
on web sites, etc..

Such documents are automatically transferred to the Mserver machine,
shredded, and stored in the document cache. The cache keeps track
of the "last-modified" time, which is checked on each request.

It is a cache, thus if full, the least frequently used documents
are unloaded from it. The default cache size is 100MB of disk space 
(can be modified using the xquery_cacheMB setting in the MonetDB.conf
configuration file of MonetDB).


Security (or the lack thereof)
------------------------------

As a security restriction, XML documents without explicityly created 
alias are currently *only* accessible when the requests are issued 
from the same machine where Mserver runs (i.e. either on the Mserver 
console in MIL, or through a MapiClient that runs on the local machine).

SECURITY WARNING: anybody logged into the Mserver machine, who 
normally has no read file permissions for files of the user that 
started Mserver, may now read all those files through MonetDB!! 

Please be aware that MonetDB is not a commercial product, and
is provided AS IS; explicitly disclaiming all responsibility for 
security issues that arise from its use. 

In the future, a (better) security mechanism including user 
authentication and SSL will be added to MonetDB.


Executing XQuery queries:
-------------------------

Use the xquery language setting of MapiClient (-lxquery or short -lx):

MapiClient -lx [files]

This executes a *single* xquery found in the file (or multiple files, which are concatenated),
or on standard input (if no file is passed), and prints the serialized result. 

In case of standard input, interactive mode is not allowed. You must pipe in a script:

MapiClient -lx < file.xq

You may request timing information with the MapiClient --time (-T) option, in which case extra 
lines are appended to the output, that split out execution time:

[Trans] XQuery-to-MIL translation time 
[Fetch] XML document load time (for XML files on the web)
[Shred] shredding time (including disk I/O)
[Query] execution time
[Print] serialization time
[Timer] total time 

The Shred time is zero, if the document was already cached on the server (or if your
query does not involve any documents). The total time may be larger than the sum of the 
other times; the difference then is communication time between MapiClient and the Mserver.

The default mode ("dm") for xquery output results are pretty-printed sequences. 
You may enforce all output to be valid XML, with the MapiClient option "-s xml". 
Your output will then be enclosed by <XQueryResult> root tags. 

The output mode (dm or xml) may be set with the xquery_output setting in the
MonetDB.conf file.

The standard TCP server port for xquery is 45789. If clashes occur, you may
change it, using the xquery_port setting in the MonetDB.conf file.


Troubleshooting:
================

Bootstrap fails if any of the requisite programs can not be found or
is an incompatible version.

Bootstrap adds files to the source directory, so it must have write
permissions.

During bootstrap, warnings like
	Remember to add `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to `configure.in'.
	You should add the contents of `/usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4' to `aclocal.m4'.
	configure.in:37: warning: do not use m4_patsubst: use patsubst or m4_bpatsubst
	configure.in:104: warning: AC_PROG_LEX invoked multiple times
	configure.in:334: warning: do not use m4_regexp: use regexp or m4_bregexp
	automake/aclocal 1.6.3 is older than 1.7.
	Patching aclocal.m4 for Intel compiler on Linux (icc/ecc).
	patching file aclocal.m4
	Hunk #1 FAILED at 2542.
	1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file aclocal.m4.rej
	patching file aclocal.m4
	Hunk #1 FAILED at 1184.
	Hunk #2 FAILED at 2444.
	Hunk #3 FAILED at 2464.
	3 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file aclocal.m4.rej
might occur.
For some technical reasons, it's hard to completely avoid them. However,
it is usually save to ignore them and simply proceed with the usual 
compilation procedure. Only in case the subsequent configure or make
do fail, these warning might have to be take more serious; in any case, 
you should include the bootstrap output in whenever you report (see below)
compilation problems.

Configure will fail if certain essential programs can't be found or
certain essential tasks (such as compiling a C program) can't be
executed.  The problem will usually be clear from the error message.

E.g., if configure cannot find package XYZ, it is either not installed
on your machine, or it is not installed in places that configure
usually searches (i.e., /usr, /usr/local).  In the first case, you need
to install package XYZ before you can configure, make, and install
MonetDB.  In the latter case, you need to tell configure via
"--with-XYZ=<DIR>" where to find packages XYZ on your machine. 
configure then looks for the respective header files in <DIR>/include,
and for the respective libraries in <DIR>/lib.

In case either of "bootstrap", "configure", or "make" fails --- especially
after a "cvs update", or after you changed some code yourself --- please try
the following steps (in that order; if you are using the pre-packages source
distribution, you have to skip steps 2 & 3):

(In case you experience problems after a "cvs update", first make sure that
 you did use "cvs update -dP" (or have a line "update -dP" in your
 ~/.cvsrc); "-d" ensures, that cvs checks out directories that have been
 added since your last "cvs update"; "-P" removed directories that have
 become empty, because all their file have been removed from the cvs
 repository. In case you did not use "cvs update -dP", re-run "cvs update
 -dP", and remember to always use "cvs update -dP" from now on (or simply
 add a line "update -dP" to your ~/.cvsrc)!)

0) In case only "make" fails, you can try to run
	make clean
   in your build-directory and proceed with step 5; 
   however, if "make" then still fails, you have to re-start with step 1.
1) Clean-up your whole build-directory (i.e., the one where you run
   "configure" and "make") by going there and running
	make maintainer-clean
   In case your build-directory is different from your source directory,
   your are even advised to remove the whole build-directory.
2) Go to the top-level source directory and run
	./de-bootstrap
   This will remove all the files that were created during "bootstrap".
3) In the top-level source directory, re-run
	./bootstrap
4) In the build-directory, re-run
	configure
   as described above.
5) In the build-directory, re-run
	make
	make install
   as described above.
