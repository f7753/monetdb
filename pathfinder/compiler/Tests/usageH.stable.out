Pathfinder XQuery Compiler ($Revision$, $Date$)
(c) University of Konstanz, DBIS group

Usage: pf [OPTION] [FILE]

  Reads from standard input if FILE is omitted.

= -h, --help: print short help message
= -H, --fullhelp: print this help message for advanced options
= -q, --quiet: do not print informational messages to log file
= -A, --enable-algebra: turn on internal algebra code.
        Don't use this, it WILL break.
= -M, --print-mil_summer: print MIL code (summer version) (default)
= -P, --print-human-readable: print internal tree structure human-readable
= -D, --print-att-dot: print internal tree structure in AT&T dot notation
= -T, --timing: print elapsed times for compiler phases
= -O[0-3], --optimize: select optimization level (default=1)
= -t, --typing: print static types (in {...}) for Core
= -s, --stop-after: stop processing after certain phase:
         1  right after input parsing
         2  after parse/abstract syntax tree has been normalized
         3  after namespaces have been checked and resolved
         4  after variable scoping has been checked
         5  after XQuery built-in functions have been loaded
         6  after valid function usage has been checked
         7  after XML Schema predefined types have been loaded
         8  after XML Schema document has been imported (if any)
         9  after the abstract syntax tree has been mapped to Core
        10  after the Core tree has been simplified/normalized
        11  after type inference and checking
        12  after XQuery Core optimization
        13  after the Core tree has been translated to the internal algebra
        14  after the algebra tree has been rewritten/optimized
        15  after the common subexpression elimination on the algebra tree
        16  after the algebra has been translated to MIL algebra
        17  after MIL algebra optimization/simplification
        18  after MIL algebra common subexpression elimination
        19  after the MIL algebra has been compiled into MIL commands
        20  after the MIL program has been serialized
= -p, --print-parse-tree: print internal parse tree
= -c, --print-core-tree: print internal Core language
= -a, --print-algebra: print internal algebra tree
= -m, --print-mil-algebra: print internal MIL algebra tree

Enjoy.
