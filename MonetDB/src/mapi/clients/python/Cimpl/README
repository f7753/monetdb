This directory contains a SWIG interface for Python to the C
implementation of the MAPI library.

Basic build instructions are in the Makefile, however, the Makefile
won't work in the source directory (since ../../C/Mapi/Mapi.h does not
exist--it is created in the build directory).

Mapi.py is the main interface.  It is a wrapper around the modules
generated by SWIG, giving a Pythonic interface to the Mapi library.  A
more direct translation of the C interface to Python is the generated
module MapiLib.py.

A tiny example of the use of Mapi.py follows:

import Mapi
m = Mapi.Mapi(host = 'localhost', port = 45123, username = 'monetdb',
              password = 'monetdb', lang = 'sql')
h = m.query('select * from tables')
while h.fetch_row() > 0:
    for i in range(h.get_field_count()):
        print repr(h.fetch_field(i)),
    print

Note that the version of SWIG that comes with RedHat 9 (swig-1.1p5-22)
is too old for the interface file.  I use swig-1.3.19.
