MonetDB extension module for PHP4.

At this moment, this module has to be compiled within PHP build structure.
That means, you need to either copy it from within MonetDB directory into 
PHP source tree or e.g.:
    ln -s $MONETDB_ROOT/src/mapi/clients/php/Cimpl $PHP_SRC/ext/monetdb

Then, regenerate PHP's configure script for the module to show up:

    cd $PHP_SRC
    rm configure; ./buildconf --force

To compile it, you need to have MONETDB_PREFIX declared in your 
environment, and then configure and install php e.g.:
    configure --with-monetdb=shared
	make 
	make install
	
Possibly in the (near) future it will be possible to compile it independently,
within MonetDB compiling/testing facilities.

monetdb.php is a demonstration of current features available in this module.
