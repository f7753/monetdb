This directory (i.e., src/modules/mnetcdf) contains a "secondary"
single-file extension module for MonetDB.

It is placed in a seperate directory instead of the contrib directory
due to a limitation in te conditional building facilities in the 
automake system.

Here, "secondary" refers to the fact that --- though (once) being considered
useful --- these modules not necessarily maintained with high priority.
