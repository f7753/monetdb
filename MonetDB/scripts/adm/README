Usage convertBBP.sh:

Persistent bats in an old database (old being
before patch gdk_bbp.dir revision 1.23.4.2
on 2001/09/15) "disappear" automatically...
unless you run this script before using them
with a recent Monet.

Yet, you should only use it once, only
on old databases, and before using the new
Monet with those old databases.

The script expects as parameter the location
of your databases, like gdk_dbfarm in monet.conf.

(NOTE: Applying the script to a newly created bat
in a new monet will make it un-destroyable - 
unless you revert the fix by decreasing the
plevel count to 1).
