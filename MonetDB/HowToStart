To compile Monet-4.2, you first need to set your (architecture dependent)
environment to be able to compile Monet-4.2. The easiest way to do so, is to

	source conf/conf.bash	(for [ba]sh users)
or
	source conf/conf.csh	(for [t]csh users)

in the top-level directory of the checked-out Monet-4.2 source tree (i.e.,
"here"; we call it "BASE" in the following).

To select your desired compiler ("GNU" or "ntv" (native)) and your desired
binary type (32bit or 64bit), set the following environment variables before
"sourcing" the conf-script:
	COMP="GNU"	or	COMP="ntv"
	BITS="32"	or	BITS="64"
(If not or wrongly set, "GNU32" is used as default.)

Further, you can set the environment variable PREFIX to select your desired
target directory. If not set, 
	PREFIX=${PWD}/`uname`
is used as default.


Once you setup your environment properly, you just need to execute the
following in BASE (i.e., "here"):

	./bootstrap
	cd ${PREFIX}
	../configure --prefix=${PREFIX}
	make
	make install


Have fun with Monet-4.2!
