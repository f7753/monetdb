MAL language issues
- Co-routine (stream) function support in the kernel
- replace module and function names with entries into a system/user id table
  [expected gain 10-20% due to less mallocs of small structures]

- derive multiplex implementations variants automatically?
- C-code generator for mal blocks to speed up expensive functions
  (and multiplex routines)
- insert(b,2) should work on bat(void,int)

- reference counting BATs through assignments should not be counted.
  a BAT disappears when the first binding variable ceases to exist.
- BBPfix/unfix can be largely dropped,because it can be managed
  at MAL level
- BATs entered into a box should become persistent? (tst1004,1005,1014)

- Realize mal.include call as a preprocessor step
- Design a macro expansion facility (with property checks)

- printing result tables should be improved.
- rethink position of enum types
- use a process buffer pool to avoid expensive client starts.

API issues
- The Japi variant should in be re-vived
- The java front-end terminal and profiler should be re-vived
- Multi-client (concurrent) access has not been tested yet
- roll-forward Mapi packages .php, .py, .tcl

- What to do with Mcreatedb and friends

V4 issues
- overlay V4 database with V5 session
- The V4 testing scheme has not been activated yet

- The group and radix modules should be brought in line with V4
- Several of the MIL scripts associated with the modules have not
  been converted yet. Reliance on scripts should be minimal

Documentation issues
- README file, document which portions are local/ opensource V4
- Monet quick reference manual update

210803 (non)-blocked interaction from Mapi and Perl working
170803 blocked io to clients finished for MAL
170803 Incremental parsing of unfinished definitions in single-line interface
150803 Removed bugs in debugger, breakpoint command now passed correctly
150803 Roll forward of modules to 4.3.13
140803 pcl module included, need some work, i.e. library loading
140803 decimal is broken, derefStr policy issue. Dropped module, outdate
100803 Mapi package rewritten
100803 PerlDBI package
230703 mal_import, better bulk loading implemented
230703 update ascii_io module
230703 sqlserver part
220703 merge the updates on the modules since early june
220703 Pattern matching against a BAT of strings, to avoid compilation
overhead of each pattern.
200703 merge updates of bm.mx
200703 merge updates of mvc.mx
200703 merge updates of logger.mx
200703 copy updates on sql/common to sql/parser
200703 merge updates of statement.mx
200703 move mkey module to V5
+ move aggrX3 operations into the group.mx module, too much work now
+ add comment phrase to Module as well
+ implement the stkTrace command
+ Mclient should be reinstalled to provide access to any scenario
+ Inclusion of the x100 instruction set, first version done
+ An XML manual generation routine should be implemented
+ Mclient should properly initialize a session
+ Name/comment cleansing over all modules/functions is needed.
