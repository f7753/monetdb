# Predefined code segment
#The compiler can not guarantee an accurate compilation,
#because MIL unlike MAL is a dynamically typed language.
#A few guidelines to maximize usefullness.
#- make the type of variables explicit, in particular 'nil'
#- upon advice of M2m to remap identifiers, change it in your program directly
#var a := new(int, int);
	a := new(:int,:int);
#a.sample(1).print();
	aa_a := sample(a,1);
	ba_a := print(aa_a,);
#quit();
	ca_a := quit();
