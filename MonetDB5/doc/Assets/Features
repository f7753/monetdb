@section The main features of MonetDB

@strong{MonetDB is a database management system}
MonetDB is an easily accessible open-source DBMS for SQL-based applications
and database research. It is used both in research and in commercial settings.

@strong{MonetDB is a multi-model system}

MonetDB supports multiple query language front-ends. Aside from
its proprietary language, called MonetDB Assembler Language (MAL),
it supports ANSI SQL-99 and W3C Xquery. Their underlying storage
models and compuational scheme differs widely. The system is designed
to provide a common ground both both, and is prepared to support
languages based on yet another syntax or processing paradigm.

@strong{MonetDB is a binary-relation database kernel}

The low level physical storage model is based on binary relations only.
The datastructures are geared towards efficient representation of these
binary relations when they mimick a n-ary relational scheme.
The literature provides ample descriptions of the technique used and the
gains obtained.

@strong{MonetDB is a broad spectrum database system}

The MonetDB is continuously developed to support a broad application
field. Its development platforms range from small embedded systems up to
multi-site distributed systems.

@strong{MonetDB is an opensource software system}

The MonetDB is developed over many years of research at @url{http://www.cwi.nl,CWI}, whose charter ensures that results are easily accessible to others.
Be it thru publication in the scientific domain, or publication of the
software components involved.
