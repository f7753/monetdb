@section The main features of MonetDB
MonetDB is an easily accessible open-source DBMS for SQL-based applications
and database research.
The features of interest for choosing MonetDB are:
@enumerate
@item
 A fairly extensive ANSI 
@url{"_ROOTDIR_/TechDocs/FrontEnds/SQL/link.shtml",SQL-99}
language interface including:
        @enumerate
        @item
            Primary and foreign key enforcement
        @item
            View management
        @item
            Sub-queries
        @item
            Authorization scheme
        @item
            Unicode support (UTF-8) 
        @end enumerate
@item
A 'swiss-army-knife' graphical front end,
@url{"_ROOTDIR_/GetGoing/Usage/Mknife/link.shtml", Mknife}.
@item
Query caching to speed-up data processing.
@item 
Extensible architecture at any level of sophistication needed.
@item 
High performance using highly tuned data structures and algorithms to
exploit the power of modern hardware.
@item
Transaction control at various levels of granularity, which makes
query dominant applications run at light speed.
@item 
Tapping into the experiences gained in supporting XML, Multimedia, GIS, etc..
applications right op top of a kernel without the overhead often encountered
in SQL-based systems.
@item
Secure access using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
@item
Broad hardware spectrum ranging
from StrongARM-based PDAs up to Opteron-based Servers (See 
@url{"_ROOTDIR_/Development/TestWeb/Platforms/link.shtml" ,platforms}).
@item
32- and 64-bit cross-platform support for:
Linux, Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOS X, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, and SGI IRIX;
(Your favorite system is not listed? --- Feel free to @url{mailto:monet@@cwi.nl" contactus!}).
@end enumerate

The MonetDB development team is actively searching for the orthogonal
features required in a DBMS kernel to fulfill its promises, i.e. to
provide application designers a stable, shared and efficient store/recall
engine for persistent data. Join the team and share your experience.
