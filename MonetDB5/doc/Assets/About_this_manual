@chapter About this manual
This is the MonetDB reference manual, which serves as the primary entry
point to locate information on its functionality,
system architecture, services, and
best practices on using its components.

The manual is produced from a Texinfo framework file, which collects
and organizes bits-and-pieces of information. 
Since the system is under constant development,
there is no guarantee of consistency
between the documentation of the individual system components.
Suggestions and help from end-users in this area is appreciated.

The Texinfo file is turned into a HTML browse-able version using 
@emph{makeinfo} program. It can also be used to produce
a Postscript version using @emph{tex2dvi} followed by 
@emph{dvips}. The PDF version can be produced from the Postscript
using @emph{ps2pdf}.
Alternative formats, e.g. XML and DocBook format, can be
readily obtained from the Texinfo file.

@section Intended Audience
The information contained in the manual is purposely dense and geared
at users with a background in database technology. Detailed information
can be obtained from the source files, which is mostly extensively
commented.

Users interested in building applications on top of the MonetDB
product suite are advised to read the following sections:

The manual does not contain a general introduction to relational DBMS 
technology, the query languages SQL and Xquery, or 
the application programming interfaces JDBC and ODBC. 
We refer to the abundance of articles and papers on these topics.

@section Manual Generation
The MonetDB code base is large collection of files, scattered
over the system modules. Each source file is written in a
literal programming style, which physically binds documentation with 
the relevant code sections. The utility program Mx processes these
files marked *.mx to extract the code sections for system
compilation or to prepare for a pretty printed listing.

The reference manual is based *.mx files prepared for @emph{Texinfo} processing. 
The components for the reference manual are extracted by
@example
Mx -i -B -H1 <filename>.mx
@end example
which generates the file <filename>.bdy.texi.
These pieces are collected and
glued together in a manual framework, running @emph{makeinfo} to produce
the desired output format.
The @emph{Texinfo} information is currently limited
to the documentation, it should be extended to also process the code.

A printable version of an *.mx file can be produced using the commands:
@example
Mx  <filename>.mx
latex <filename>.tex
@end example
The result, however, still includes the unexpanded tex info macros.
