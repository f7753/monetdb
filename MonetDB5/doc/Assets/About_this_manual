@chapter About this manual
This is the MonetDB reference manual, which serves as the primary entry
point to locate information on its functionality,
system architecture, services, and
best practices on using its components.

The manual is produced from a Texinfo framework file, which collects
and organizes bits-and-pieces of information scattered around the many
source components comprising the MonetDB software family. 
Since the system is under constant development,
there is no guarantee of consistency
between the documentation of the individual system components.
Suggestions and help from end-users in this area is appreciated.

The Texinfo file is turned into a HTML browse-able version using 
@emph{makeinfo} program. It can also be used to produce
a Postscript version using @emph{tex2dvi} followed by 
@emph{dvips}. The PDF version can be produced from the Postscript
using @emph{ps2pdf}.
Alternative formats, e.g. XML and DocBook format, can be
readily obtained from the Texinfo file.

@emph{Disclaimer} The reference manual is still under development,
much like the underlying source code base. This may lead to 
incomplete and inconsistencies descriptions,
for which we apologize in advance. You can help improving the manual
using the user commentary system included in the web-site.

@section Intended Audience
The MonetDB reference manual is aimed at programmers and application
developers with an intermediate level exposure to database technology,
its embedding in host environments such as C, PHP, or middleware
solutions based on JDBC and ODBC.

The route towards becoming a database application expert is long
and hard. It requires building experiences from small toy examples
towards large business critical application.
The MonetDB reference manual is not designed for this purpose,
but in combination with the abundance of articles and papers on the web
it should be possible to create your first MonetDB/SQL application
without much difficulty.

Users interested in building applications on top of the MonetDB
product suite are advised to read the following sections:
@iftex
@enumerate
@item
Getting started
@item 
The SQL language
@end enumerate
@end iftex
@menu
* Installation ::
* SQL ::
* The application interfaces::
@end menu

The bulk of the MonetDB reference manual exposes the techniques
available in the back-end and which provides the basis for really
high-performent applications.

More detailed information can be obtained from the source files, which 
is mostly extensively commented.

@section Manual Generation
The MonetDB code base is large collection of files, scattered
over the system modules. Each source file is written in a
literal programming style, which physically binds documentation with 
the relevant code sections. The utility program Mx processes these
files marked *.mx to extract the code sections for system
compilation or to prepare for a pretty printed listing.

The reference manual is based *.mx files prepared for @emph{Texinfo} processing. 
The components for the reference manual are extracted by
@example
Mx -i -B -H1 <filename>.mx
@end example
which generates the file <filename>.bdy.texi.
These pieces are collected and
glued together in a manual framework, running @emph{makeinfo} to produce
the desired output format.
The @emph{Texinfo} information is currently limited
to the documentation, it should be extended to also process the code.

A printable version of an *.mx file can be produced using the commands:
@example
Mx  <filename>.mx
latex <filename>.tex
@end example
The result, however, still includes the unexpanded tex info macros.

The conventions used in this manual are straightforward.
The program snippets follow the style of the @emph{texi} example
environment.
