@section{Platforms supported.}
The MonetDB development team uses Linux platforms running Fedora 4.
However, a major investment has been made to assure portability
of a wide-range of alternative systems, being Linux distribution
variations(e.g. SUSE), native operating systems (e.g. Windows),
hardware boxes (e.g. SGI,SUN,Apple,..,Gumstix),
and memory base lines (32/64 bits).

An automatic testing scheme has been in place for several years
to ensure portability. Every day about 20 different platforms
(hardware and compilers) are challenged with the hundreds of
test cases. Deviances can be easily be tracked on the Testweb.

We are keen to learn from portability problems, provided the base
toolkit (automake,config) from the Linux setting is already in place.
