MonetDB is an open source high-performance database system developed at 
@url{_ROOTURL_/Development/Developers/, CWI}, the Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science Research of The Netherlands.
It was designed to provide high performance on complex queries against 
large databases, e.g. combining tables with hundreds of columns and multi-million rows. 
As such, MonetDB can be used in application areas that performance-wise are no-go 
areas for using traditional database technology in a real-time manner. MonetDB has been 
successfully applied in high performance applications for data mining, 
@acronym{OLAP,On-Line Analytical Processing}, 
@acronym{GIS,Geographic Information System}, 
@acronym{XML, "eXtensible Markup Language},
text- and multimedia retrieval.

MonetDB achieves this goal using innovations at all layers of a DBMS: a storage model based 
on vertical fragmentation, a modern CPU-tuned vectorized query execution architecture that 
often gives MonetDB a more than 10-fold raw speed advantage on the same algorithm over
a typical interpreter-based RDBMS.  MonetDB is one of the first database systems to focus 
its query optimization effort on exploiting CPU caches. MonetDB also features automatic
and self-tuning indexes, run-time query optimization, a modular software architecture, etc..
