The Monet Binary Distribution.
=============================

Monet is a high-performance database kernel developed and
copyrighted 1993-1997 by the database research group of
prof. dr. Martin Kersten at CWI and SION.

You can also visit the Monet website @ http://www.cwi.nl/~monet

Documentation is in HTML format and starts in the file 'index.html'.
Choose 'Documentation' to obtain a short overview of Monet and 
installation instructions for the binary distribution, and compilation
instructions for the source distribution.

Directories in the binary distribution:
	<arch>/bin/		Monet runnable programs.
	<arch>/lib/		libraries and compiled modules.
	<arch>/include/		header files (for extension programmers).
	scripts/		standard MIL scripts.
	www/			HTML documentation
	dbfarm/			database directory (empty)

The source distribution lacks any <arch> directories with compiled files,
but brings the following extra files: 
	Makefile		The global super-makefile for Monet
	makefiles/		System specific makefiles.
	src/			Main source directory with entries 
				gdk/ monet/ tools/ mel/ and utils/
	modules/		Standard extension modules 
				including the odmg layer.

For those without the patience to read the documentation,
at least make sure that:
- the Monet tools (located in <arch>/bin/) are in your PATH,
- the <arch>/lib/ directory is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH

You might try creating the 'gold' demo database, in 'scripts/gold'
