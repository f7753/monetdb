@node Client administration, Session scenarios, Session management, Session management
@* Monet Client Interface
Clients gain access to the Monet server through a internet connection
or through its server console.
Access through the internet requires a Monet client program at the
source, but ordinary telnet connections can be applied when the internet
port number of the database server is publicised.

At the server side, each client is represented by a session record about the
current status, such as name, file descriptors, namespace, and local stack.
Each client session has a dedicated thread of control, which limits
the number of concurrent users to the thread management facilities of the
underlying OS. A large client base should be supported using
a single serverside client thread, geared at providing
a particular service.

The number of clients permitted concurrent access is 
currently a compile time option.
They are referenced internally by number. The console is the first and 
should always be present. It reads from standard input and writes to 
standard output.

Client records are linked into a hierarchy, where the top record
denotes the context of the Monet administrator. The next layer
is formed by a database administrator and the third layer contains
user sessions.
This hierachy is used to share and constrain resources, such
as global variables or references to catalogue information.
During parallel execution additional layers may be constructed.

The prompt structure is designed to simplify recognition
of the language framework for interaction. For direct console
access it is a short printable ascii string. For access through
an API we assume the prompt is an ascii string surrounded by a \001
character. This simplifies recognition.
The information between the prompt brackets can be used to
pass the mode to the front-end. Moreover, the prompt can be
dropped if a single stream of information is expected from the
server(See mal_profiler.mx).
@-
The user can request server-side compilation as part of the 
initialization string. See the documentation on Scenarios.

The actions for a client is separated into several stages: parsing,
strategic optimization, tactial optimization, and execution. 
The routines to handle them are obtained once the scenario is choosen.
Each stage carries a state descriptor, but they share the IO state
description. A backup structure is provided
to temporarily switch to another scenario. Propagation of the state
information should be dealt with separately.[TODO]

Client sessions remain in existence until the corresponding

A client can manipulate the timeout with a system call.

Communication channels for the interconnect are stored here.
It is perfectly legal to have a client without input stream.
It will simple terminate after consuming the input buffer.
The monitor file descriptor can be set to trace the input received
from a particular client. This facility is used by Mapi to trace
the interaction on the system console (sysmon).

In interactive mode, reading one line at a time, we should be
aware of parsing compound structures, such as functions and
barrier blocks. The level of nesting is maintained in blkmode,
which is reset to zero upon encountering an end instruction,
or the closing bracket has been detected. Once the complete
structure has been parsed the program can be checked and executed.
Nesting is indicated using a '+' before the prompt.

Upon acceptance of a connection a client record is initialized.
After initializion the client record is activated in its own
thread of control until it finds a
soft-termination request mode (FINISHING) or its IO file
descriptors are closed. This will generate an IO error, which
should lead to a safe termination.

The system administrator client runs in the primary thread of
control to simplify debugging with external debuggers.

A new Client structure can only be requested if the 'adm'
user is available, because it guarantees a way to deliver
any error message.
Searching a free client record is encapsulated in
a critical section to hand them out one-at-a-time.
Marking them as being claimed avoids any interference from parallel
actions to obtain client records.

@- Client decendants
Forking is a relatively cheap way to create a new client.
The new client record shares the IO descriptors.
To avoid interference, we limit children to only produce 
output by closing the input-side.

If the father itself is a temporary client, let 
the new child depend on the grandfather.
@{
@c
Client forkClient(Client father){
        Client son = NULL;
    if( father == NULL) return NULL;

@-

When a client needs to be terminated then the file descriptors for
its input/output are simply closed. 
This leads to a graceful degradation, but may take some time
when the client is busy.
A more forcefull method is to kill the client thread, but this
may leave locks and semaphores in an undesirable state.

The routine freeClient ends a single client session,
but through side effects of sharing IO descriptors,
also its children. Conversely, a child can not close a parent.
@{

void freeClient(Client c)

    c->mode = FINISHING;

@-
If a client disappears from the scene (eof on stream), we should
terminate all its children. This is in principle a forcefull action,
because the children may be ignoring the primary IO streams.
(Instead they may be blocked in an infinite loop)

Special care should be taken by closing the 'adm' thread.
It is permitted to leave only when it is the sole user of the system.

Furthermore, once we enter closeClient, the process in which it is
raised has already lost its file descriptors.
@c
void closeClient(Client c) {
    Client k;

#ifdef MAL_DEBUG_CLIENT
    printf("closeClient %d %s\n",c-mal_clients,c->user);
#endif
    /* kill living background clients */
    for (k = mal_clients; k < mal_clients+MAL_MAXCLIENTS; k++) {
        if ((k->mode > FINISHING) && (k->father == c)) 
            killClient(k);
    }

    /* free resources of a single thread */
    if( !isAdministrator(c)) {
        freeClient(c);
        return;
    } 

    /* adm is set to disallow new clients entering */
    mal_clients[CONSOLE].mode= FINISHING;

    for (k = mal_clients+1; k < mal_clients+MAL_MAXCLIENTS; k++) 
    if ((k->mode > FINISHING) ){
        GDKerror("closeClient:client '%s' is still active\n", k->user);
        killClient(k);

    mal_exit(c);
    /* MT_global_exit(0); not needed ?*/
}

@-
Killing a (child) client is a delicate action, because the state of
the client is unknown. The current solution is to issue
a soft-termination request first by setting its mode flag. 
The client main interpreter loop should look at it upon each
cycle and terminate.

After the PROCESSTIMEOUT delay the thread is forcefully killed,
assuming it was either waiting for a lock, or external
event in any way.

The current code is not correct. It should selectively kill
a pthread, rather waiting for them to finish the request being
handled.  Since they may be waiting for IO this can take a
very long time, since we have access to the file descriptor it may
work by closing them.
@c 

void killClient(Client c){
    if (c && c->user) {
#ifdef MAL_DEBUG_CLIENT

@+ Client input
Input to be processed is collected in a Client specific buffer.
It is filled by reading information from a stream, or by scheduling
strings constructed internally. The latter involves removing
any escape character needed to manipulate the string within
the kernel.
The buffer space is automatically expanded to accommodate new 
information and the read pointers are adjusted.

@-
The input is read from a (blocked) stream and stored in the client record
input buffer. The storage area grows automatically upon need.
The origin of the input stream depends on the connectivity mode.

Most interactions should be regulated through the Mclient
front-end. This will also take care of buffering a request before
submission. This avoids a significant number of network interactions.

@{
@-
Each operation received from a front-end consists of at least one line.
If it contains the text #bytes:%6d then it is assumed that a block
of data can be read in bulk mode containing the request to be processed.

Otherwise the line is interpreted as a MAL instruction and appended
to the main-procedure associated with a client record. As soon as a
statementblock is recognized, it is taken into execution.

To simplify misaligned communication with front-ends, we use different
prompts structures. [think, can we avoid acks]

}
@-
The default action is to read information from an ascii-stream
one line at a time. This is the preferred mode for reading
from terminal.
@-
The next statement block is to be read. Sent a prompt to warn
the front-end to issue the request.
