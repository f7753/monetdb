@* MIL algebra extensions
MonetDB 5 supports running MIL programs compiled by M2m.
The resulting code needs PROC definitions of version 4, which
are assembled in this package.

We removed the ADDHELP functionality, because
M5 does not use the same catalog infrastructure 
Several procs were removed, because they seemed
to be unnecessary or complicates the handling in M5 
(polymorphic anonymous types)


The mal code was produced using
	M2m --trace=0 mil_algebra_procs.mil
[The trace flag removes the comment lines]
