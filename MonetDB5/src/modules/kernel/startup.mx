@* Monet Startup file
The Monet kernel needs a minimal set of modules to work properly.
They are loaded using one operation, namely 'use "kernel/startup"'

Additional modules can be selectively loaded later.

The dependency among the modules require some care. 
All modules are put into a linked list, which is traversed
in a lifo order to search for a matching signature.
