@* Mal atom startup file
Upon starting the Monet/MAL server we need to initialize the symbol table.
This encompasses loading the signatures of several key modules.

The initial load phase comprises 'pure' atomary datatypes, i.e. those that
do not rely on the Monet kernel primitives for representation.

The negative effect is that this module is inspected as part of
the function resolution scheme.

In practice, we have to introduce different startup for each
client group or database.
