The defacto language for database applications is SQL.  It evolved
through several phases of standardization to the version currently
known as SQL-2003.<br />
The SQL standard provides an ideal language framework, 
in terms of standardization committee viewpoints.  It is, however,
hardly met by any of the existing (commercial) implementations.
This is largely due to legacy of old software and backward compatability
requirements from their client base.  See for instance
<a href="http://www.dbazine.com/gulutzan3.shtml" target="_blank">this
online article on SQL standards</a>.
<p />
The MonetDB database system was originally developed as a database backend
kernel with its own, low-level algebraic interface and scripting language.
The development of a SQL frontend has been purposely postponed to the point
where the kernel code base was sufficiently mature and field tested in
large, mission critial applications in the financial sector.
<p />
In 2002 the first version of the SQL frontend emerged.
This late development made it possible to immediately start from the SQL'99
definition. As soon as the SQL'03 specifications became available, its content
was taken as the primary frame of reference.
The SQL development strategy is driven by immediate needs of the
user base, such that less-frequently used features end up low on
the development stack.
<p />
The purpose of this document is to give a quick introduction on the SQL
frontend, its limitations, and the way to use it.  Throughout this document
proficiency in elementary use of SQL is assumed.<br />

language interfaces can be found on the
