This document will help you execute the first SQL query on a Monet
database backend.

This document assumes that you have compiled and installed both the
Monet back-end and SQL front-end according to the 'HowToStart' descriptions.
Furthermore, the sanity test checks included did do not produce fatal errors.

Prerequisites:
==============
SQL	You should have a basic understanding of SQL syntax.
	In particular, the SQL front-end is based on SQL-3
	standard.

Monet	You should be able to start/stop de Monet database server on
	a given database. 

Getting started
==============
Before you start, make sure that both back-end and front-end can be found.
The command `which Mserver` and `which Msql` should return the proper path
to the binaries. Likewise, make sure the database directory exists and you 
have proper file access permissions.

The Monet server does not contain hardwired knowledge on its SQL frontend.
It must be initialized and told to accept SQL sessions. In a separate window
start the server for a new SQL database (named VOC);

$ mkdir -p $PREFIX/var/dbfarm/VOC
$ Mserver --dbname=VOC 
# Monet Database Server V4.3.14
# Copyright (c) 1993-2002, CWI. All rights reserved.
# compiled for i686-pc-linux-gnu/32bit; dynamically linked.
monet>module(sql_server);
monet>

Here $PREFIX denotes the path where Monet has been installed.
All databases are kept in $PREFIX/var/dbfarm unless this location
has been changed in the monet.conf file.

The server is initialized by loading the SQL module. It will listen
to a default port for requests.

If you get an error message, e.g. 'port already in use', you might have 
obsolete Mserver processes hanging around which should be killed first.

SQL Frontends
============
The distribution comes with a simple front-end, called Msql. It is
similar in functionality as Mapiclient, ie it provides
a textual interface with command-line history features.

To connect to the running Monet SQL server type:

$ Msql
User:monetdb
Password:monetdb
>
The user name and password are default and provide SQL administrator rights.
(See SQL authorization)

To be assured of a proper SQL environment, you could inspect the catalog
tables as follows:

Msql> select name from tables;
#  Name			]
#------------------------
[ "schemas"		]
[ "tables"		]
[ "columns"		]
[ "keys"		]
[ "keycolumns"		]
[ "users"		]
[ "auths"		]
[ "user_role"		]
[ "table_privileges"	]
[ "column_privileges"	]
10 Rows affected
Msql> select t.name, c.name, c.type, c.null, c.default from columns c, tables t 
   where t.name="tables" and  t.id= c.table_id;

The distribution comes with a small sample database for the historical
multinational VOC (East-Indian Trading Company 1595-1798)
The schema is kept around in .../src/test/VOC where ... denotes the 
toplevel directory where you installed the sql frontend.

The single table used in this example is created as follows:
Msql> create table voyage(
Msql>         number integer,
Msql>         trip   integer,
Msql>	      boatname varchar(25),
Msql>         master varchar(25),
Msql>         tonnage integer,
Msql>         birth   varchar(10),
Msql>         acquired integer,
Msql>         yard    varchar(1),
Msql>         chamber varchar(1),
Msql>         departure       date,
Msql>         harbour varchar(12),
Msql>         cape_arrival date,
Msql>         cape_departure date,
Msql>         destination_arrival date,
Msql>         destination_harbour varchar(12)
Msql> );

To load the database with a small sample use the command
Msql> copy 5 records into voyage from '.../src/test/VOC/VOCsample.csv'
Msql> using delimiters ',','\n';
 
The few tuples added can be shown with
Msql> select distinct boatname,master from voyage;
#---------------------
#| boatname | master |
#---------------------
"BRESLAU"       "Jan Kornelis Roos"
"LES DEUX SOEURS"       "Blankman"
"POTSDAM"       "Bernard Christiaan Muller"
"GERECHTIGHEID" "Isaak Segon"
"MAGDEBURG"     "Asuerus Brinkman"

Msql>

The VOC database in its full incarnation contains over 8 thousand
records. To retrieve part of it, you have to use selection and order
by predicates. A few illustrative SQL statements are shown.

Msql> select boatname,destination_arrival from voyage order by destination_arrival;
#----------------------------------
#| boatname | destination_arrival |
#----------------------------------
"LES DEUX SOEURS"       nil
"BRESLAU"       1783-08-06
"POTSDAM"       1783-08-09

"GERECHTIGHEID" 1783-11-08

Views
=====
The result of a query can be saved in a new table as follows:
To avoid cluttering the database, we remove all the tuples in R
(or simply drop the table).

It expects each tuple to be represented on a separate line and
conforms to the Monet tuple format lexical structure.
You can specify the column value separator. The defaults is

SQL-3 Limitations:
============
The current SQL implementation can be characterised as SQL-92++.
It is based on the syntax and semantics of SQL-3, but does not
implement the complete language. In particular, it does not yet
support ADTs, modules, and triggers. Likewise, some of the functionality
of extended datatypes (e.g. blobs) are not included in the Monet
server libraries.

Documentation:
==============

The documentation starts in <monet_dir>/doc/monet.html

NOTE: the current 'make install' does not yet generate this
      documentation to do this manually, execute *after* successful
      'make install'. In the top-level directory of the MonetDB build
      tree, call

 make html


Troubleshooting:
================
The current implementation is a beta version, which means that occasionally 
you encounter bugs reported at the back-end. This may lead to a hanging
front-end as well. To illustrate, the next statement
