This directory contains tests copied from the PostgreSQL source tree.

For now a few simple scripts are provided to run the tests, and no integration
with the Mtesting framework is made, as most - if not all - of the tests are
bound to fail.
Some of the tests require the data from the data directory to be loaded. SQL
scripts are supplied to load these.  For the onek and tenk datafiles, the
wisconsin load script in the wisconsin benchmark directory should be loaded.
(ie. JdbcClient -f ../../benchmarks/wisconsin/load.sql -Xbatching 400)

bad_tests
	this file contains the names of the scripts that most probably will never
	run with MonetDB/SQL because they are targetted at specific PostgreSQL
	features
postgresql2sql99.sh
	this script does an attempt to convert all files from the sql directory
	into sql99 compatible scripts in the sql99 directory which is created
	if not yet existant.
runtest.sh
	runs a given test (example: sh runtest.sh sql99/varchar.sql) and
	compares the output to the expected output from PostgreSQL.  The script
	tries to make the diff as small and accurate as possible, but differences
	between the outputs of JdbcClient and pgsql will always be there.
