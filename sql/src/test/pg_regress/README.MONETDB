This directory contains tests copied from the PostgreSQL source tree.

For now a few simple scripts are provided to run the tests, and no integration
with the Mtesting framework is made, as most - if not all - of the tests are
bound to fail.

postgresql2sql99.sh
	this script does an attempt to convert all files from the sql directory
	into sql99 compatible scripts in the sql99 directory which is created
	if not yet existant.
runtest.sh
	runs a given test (example: sh runtest.sh sql99/varchar.sql) and
	compares the output to the expected output from PostgreSQL.  The script tries
	to make the diff as small and accurate as possible, but differences between
	the outputs of JdbcClient and pgsql will always be there.
